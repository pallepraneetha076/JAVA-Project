**1. About the Project**

**Project Title:** Budget Tracker Application

**Purpose:**
The project is a **personal finance management system** that helps users track their income and expenses. You will implement it in **Java** (console-based or GUI). The goal is to **practice Java programming, object-oriented concepts, and project development skills**.

**Key Functionalities:**

1. Add income and expense transactions
2. Categorize transactions (food, rent, travel, etc.)
3. View total balance
4. View summary reports (optional: monthly or category-wise)
5. Edit or delete transactions (optional)
6. Optional enhancements: charts, file/database storage, or GUI

## **2. Expected Outcome**

By the end of the project, you should have:

* **A working Java program** that can:

  * Take user input for income/expense
  * Store transactions
  * Show summary and balance
  * (Optional) Visualize data or save to a file/database

* **Report:** Explaining your design, code structure, testing, and results

* **PPT / Presentation:** Summarizing objectives, features, design, demo, and learning

* **Demo:** A live demonstration of your program working

## **4. Technology**

* **Core Language:** Java
* **Optional Enhancements:**

  * GUI: Java Swing or JavaFX
  * Database: SQLite or MySQL for saving transactions
  * Charts: JFreeChart for graphical representation

**Important:** If your project is beginner-level, a **console-based Java application** is sufficient. GUI and database are optional enhancements.

## **5. Outcome / Skills You Will Learn**

1. **Programming Skills:** Java, OOP concepts, collections, file I/O
2. **Project Skills:** Planning, designing classes, implementing features, debugging
3. **Documentation Skills:** Writing project report, creating PPT
4. **Presentation Skills:** Explaining your project and demonstrating functionality

**Final Deliverable Example:**

* A **Java program** that lets the user:

  * Add income/expense with category and date
  * See all transactions
  * View total balance
  * Optional: export data, visual summary
* **Report** explaining your code and results
* **Presentation** summarizing the project


✅ How to Run the Project

Setup:

Install Java JDK on your system.

Use VS Code with the Java Extension Pack.

Create a folder called BudgetTracker and save both .java files inside.

Compile & Run:

javac Transaction.java BudgetTracker.java
java BudgetTracker


Optional Enhancements:

Save transactions to a file (CSV/Text).

Add GUI with Swing/JavaFX.

Add charts using JFreeChart.

Push the project to GitHub for version control.
