## Problem Definition

In today’s world, people often struggle to manage their personal finances effectively. It becomes difficult to keep track of how much money is earned, spent, and saved.
Manual tracking (using notebooks or calculators) is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

The problem is to develop a simple Java-based application that helps users:

Record and organize their income and expenses

Categorize spending (e.g., food, rent, travel, etc.)

View a summary of total income, expenses, and remaining balance

Update or delete transactions when needed

Hence, the project aims to build a Budget Tracker Application that provides an easy, interactive, and reliable way to manage personal financial data.

## Scope of the Project

The scope defines what the system will and will not do.

In Scope (what the project will do):

Allow users to add, edit, and delete income/expense records

Categorize transactions

Display a list of all transactions

Show a financial summary (total income, expense, and balance)

Provide a simple console-based interface for interaction

Store data temporarily during runtime (using Java ArrayList)

Out of Scope (future enhancements):

Persistent data storage using files or databases

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Swing or JavaFX

Visual reports and charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs)

Multi-user login or online synchronization

## How to Run
1. Compile: javac Transaction.java BudgetTracker.java
